# Footnote

A footnote provides supplementary information, citations, or clarifications that support the main content without cluttering it. Footnotes are commonly used in articles, academic writing, legal documents, and documentation to reference sources, define terms, or add context.

This component renders as a semantic `<aside>` element with `role="note"`, giving screen readers clear indication that the content is supplementary. Each footnote is identified by a unique `id`, allowing in-page links from superscript reference markers in the main text to jump directly to the footnote.

## Implementation Notes

- Renders as `<aside>` with `role="note"` for semantic supplementary content
- The `id` prop serves double duty: it identifies the element for in-page linking and provides the `aria-label` value
- Accepts a `children` slot for flexible footnote content (text, links, citations)
- Spreads `restProps` onto the `<aside>` element for consumer customization

## Props

- `id`: string (required) -- unique footnote identifier, used for the element id and aria-label
- `children`: slot (required) -- footnote content to render inside the aside

## Usage

```html
<Footnote id="fn1">Source: Example et al., 2024</Footnote>
```

```html
<!-- In-page link from main content to footnote -->
<p>This claim is supported by research.<a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<!-- Footnote at the bottom of the page or section -->
<Footnote id="fn1">
  <a href="#ref1">1.</a> Example, A. (2024). <em>Research Title</em>. Journal Name.
</Footnote>
```

## Keyboard Interactions

None -- this component is a passive container. Keyboard navigation is handled by any interactive elements placed inside the footnote by the consumer (such as links).

## ARIA

- `role="note"` -- indicates supplementary content that is related to the main content
- `aria-label="{id}"` -- provides an accessible name derived from the footnote identifier

## When to Use

- Use for citations, source references, or supplementary clarifications in articles, academic content, or legal documents.
- Use when the additional information should not interrupt the main content flow.
- Avoid for critical information the user must read; use InformationCallout or Alert instead.

## Headless

This headless component provides an `<aside>` with `role="note"` and an `id` for in-page linking from superscript reference markers. The consumer provides all visual styling including indentation, font size, numbering, and separator lines.

## Advice

- **Designers**: Position footnotes at the bottom of the page or section with a clear visual separator. Use smaller text to distinguish footnotes from body content.
- **Developers**: Ensure the `id` prop matches the `href` fragment on the in-page link (e.g., `<a href="#fn1">`) for proper jump-to-footnote navigation.
