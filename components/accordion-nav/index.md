# Accordion Nav

An accordion nav is a navigation container that organizes and displays content in a space-efficient, collapsible format. It consists of vertically stacked sections, each with a clickable header that expands or collapses its associated content. This design helps reduce visual clutter, allowing users to focus on one section at a time while keeping other content hidden until needed. Commonly used in FAQs, filters, or mobile menus, accordions enhance usability by streamlining content access and improving navigation on both desktop and mobile interfaces.

The AccordionNav component serves as the outer wrapper. Place an AccordionList inside it, containing AccordionListItem children for the individual collapsible sections.

## Help

Use AccordionNav as the outermost container for an accordion component. Common scenarios include FAQ sections, settings panels, filter groups, and mobile navigation menus. Pair with AccordionList, AccordionListItem, AccordionSummary, and AccordionDetails.

## Syntax

```html
<AccordionNav label="...">
  <!-- AccordionList with AccordionListItem children -->
</AccordionNav>
```

## Usage

```html
<AccordionNav label="FAQ">
  <AccordionList>

    </AccordionListItem>
  </AccordionList>

## Keyboard Interactions

None -- this component is a passive container. Keyboard interactions are handled by AccordionListItem children.

## ARIA

- `role="region"` -- identifies the accordion as a landmark region
- `aria-label` -- provides an accessible name for the region, allowing screen readers to announce it
## When to Use

- Use for grouping collapsible content sections such as FAQ pages, settings panels, filter groups, or mobile navigation menus.
- Use when you need a labeled navigation landmark that wraps accordion items.
- Avoid for simple show/hide of a single section -- use Details or Collapsible instead.
- Consider TabBar instead when users need to see content from multiple sections simultaneously.

## Headless

This component provides a `<nav>` landmark with `role="region"` and `aria-label` for accessibility, with zero visual styling. The consumer is responsible for all CSS including container borders, background colors, spacing, and overall layout. Use the `data-*` attributes or element selectors as styling hooks.

## Advice

- **Designers**: Ensure the accordion has clear visual boundaries so users can distinguish it from surrounding content. Provide a visible label or heading above the accordion group.
- **Developers**: Always provide a meaningful `label` prop that describes the accordion's purpose for screen reader users navigating by landmarks.

## Composition

AccordionNav follows the Nav / List / ListItem composition pattern:

- **AccordionNav** -- outer `<nav>` container providing the landmark region and accessible label.
- **AccordionList** -- `<ol>` list grouping the collapsible items in order.
- **AccordionListItem** -- individual `<details>` / `<summary>` sections for each expandable item.

```html
<AccordionNav label="FAQ">
  <AccordionList>
    <AccordionListItem summary="Question 1">Answer 1</AccordionListItem>
    <AccordionListItem summary="Question 2">Answer 2</AccordionListItem>
  </AccordionList>
</AccordionNav>
```
