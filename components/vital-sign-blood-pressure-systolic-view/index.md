# Vital Sign Blood Pressure Systolic View

VitalSignBloodPressureSystolicView is a headless read-only display of a systolic blood pressure value in mmHg. It renders a `<span>` with `role="img"` and an accessible label describing the value and unit.

Use this component to display a patient's systolic blood pressure in medical records, health dashboards, vital sign summaries, and wellness applications.

## Implementation Notes

- Renders a `<span>` element with `role="img"` for a read-only numeric display
- Uses `aria-label` for an accessible description (e.g., "120 mmHg systolic")
- The `value` prop is the integer systolic blood pressure in mmHg
- Spreads `restProps` onto the span for consumer customization
- Companion to VitalSignBloodPressureSystolicInput for the Input/View pattern

## Props

- `value`: number (required) -- systolic blood pressure value in mmHg
- `label`: string (required) -- accessible description via `aria-label` (e.g., "120 mmHg systolic")
- `...restProps`: unknown -- additional attributes spread onto the `<span>` element

## Usage

```html
<VitalSignBloodPressureSystolicView value={120} label="120 mmHg systolic" />
```

## Keyboard Interactions

None. This is a passive, read-only display element.

## ARIA

- `role="img"` -- identifies the span as a visual/graphic display element
- `aria-label={label}` -- provides the full value description for screen readers

## When to Use

- Use to display a systolic blood pressure reading in vital sign summaries, medical records, or health dashboards.
- Use as the display companion to VitalSignBloodPressureSystolicInput.
- Avoid using for editable blood pressure values; use VitalSignBloodPressureSystolicInput instead.

## Headless

This headless component provides a `<span>` with `role="img"` and `aria-label`. The consumer provides all visual styling including font size, color coding for normal/abnormal ranges, and unit label display.

## Styles

The consumer provides all CSS styling. The component renders with a `.vital-sign-blood-pressure-systolic-view` class for targeting. Common styling includes color coding for blood pressure categories (green for normal <120, yellow for elevated 120-129, orange for stage 1 hypertension 130-139, red for stage 2 hypertension >=140).

## Testing

- Verify the component renders a `<span>` element with `role="img"`
- Verify `aria-label` is set from the `label` prop
- Verify the `value` is displayed as text content
- Verify `data-value` attribute is set
- Verify pass-through attributes are applied

## Advice

- **Designers**: Display "mmHg" as a unit label alongside the number. Use color coding to indicate blood pressure categories: normal (<120), elevated (120-129), stage 1 hypertension (130-139), stage 2 hypertension (>=140).
- **Developers**: The `label` prop should include both the value and unit for screen readers (e.g., "120 mmHg systolic"). Consider using `data-value` for conditional CSS styling based on category.

## Domain Knowledge

Blood pressure measures the force of blood against artery walls, with normal readings typically below 120/80 mmHg. The systolic value (top number) measures the pressure when the heart beats.

- Normal: Less than 120 mmHg systolic.
- Elevated: 120-129 mmHg systolic AND less than 80 diastolic.
- Stage 1 Hypertension: 130-139 mmHg systolic OR 80-89 diastolic.
- Stage 2 Hypertension: 140 or higher systolic OR 90 or higher diastolic.
- Hypertensive Crisis: Higher than 180 systolic AND/OR higher than 120 diastolic.
- Management: Reduce salt intake, regular physical activity, maintain healthy weight, and smoking cessation.
- When to Seek Help: If reading is higher than 180/120 with symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, back pain, numbness/weakness, or changes in vision.
