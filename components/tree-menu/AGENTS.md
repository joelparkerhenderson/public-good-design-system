# Tree Menu

## Metadata

- Component: tree-menu
- PascalCase: TreeMenu
- Description: a hierarchical tree menu with expandable branches
- HTML tag: <div>
- CSS class: .tree-menu
- Interactive: yes

## Key Behaviors

- Renders a `<ul>` element with `role="tree"` for tree view semantics
- Uses reactive state to track the tree element reference for keyboard navigation
- Queries `[role="treeitem"]` descendants to build the navigable item list
- Arrow key navigation wraps around from last to first item and vice versa
- Consumer provides `<li role="treeitem">` children with `tabindex="-1"` for focusability
- Accepts `...restProps` for forwarding additional attributes to the list element

## ARIA

- `role="tree"` -- identifies the container as a tree view widget
- `aria-label={label}` -- provides an accessible name for the tree
- Consumer items should use `role="treeitem"` on each navigable child

## Keyboard

- Arrow Down: Move focus to the next tree item (wraps to first)
- Arrow Up: Move focus to the previous tree item (wraps to last)
- Home: Move focus to the first tree item
- End: Move focus to the last tree item

## Props

- `label`: string (required) -- accessible name applied via `aria-label`
- `children`: slot (required) -- tree item elements, expected to be `<li role="treeitem">` elements
