# Time Input

A time input provides a field for entering time values using the native HTML `<input type="time">` element. It renders a time picker control appropriate to the user's browser and operating system, allowing users to enter hours and minutes in a localized format.

This component is useful for scheduling interfaces, appointment forms, event planners, and any form that requires time-of-day entry. The bindable value uses HH:MM format (24-hour) and supports required and disabled states. It uses `aria-label` for accessibility.

## Implementation Notes

- Renders a native `<input type="time">` element
- Uses `aria-label` for accessible naming (no visible label element included; consumers can add their own)
- Supports two-way binding for the `value` prop, enabling two-way `value` binding in the parent
- Supports two-way binding on the `value` prop
- Value format is HH:MM (24-hour time string, e.g., "14:30")
- Supports standard HTML form attributes: `required`, `disabled`
- Spreads `restProps` for consumer customization (e.g., `min`, `max`, `step`)

## Props

- `label`: string (required) -- accessible name via `aria-label`
- `value`: string (default: `""`, bindable) -- current time value in HH:MM format, supports two-way binding
- `required`: boolean (default: `false`) -- whether the field is required
- `disabled`: boolean (default: `false`) -- whether the field is disabled
- `...restProps`: any additional HTML attributes spread onto the input

## Usage

```html
<TimeInput label="Start time" value={value} />
```

```html
<TimeInput label="Meeting time" value={meetingTime} required={true} />
```

```html
<TimeInput label="Deadline" value={deadline} min="09:00" max="17:00" />
```

## Keyboard Interactions

None beyond native input behavior -- the browser's built-in time picker handles keyboard interactions (arrow keys to adjust hours/minutes, Tab between segments).

## ARIA

- `aria-label={label}` -- provides an accessible name for the input since no visible `<label>` element is included

## When to Use

- Use TimeInput when users need to enter a specific time value in a form, such as scheduling, appointments, or deadlines.
- Use for straightforward time-of-day entry where the native browser time picker is sufficient.
- Avoid using TimeInput for time duration or elapsed time; consider a custom duration input instead.
- Consider TimePicker when you need additional time selection features beyond the native input.

## Headless

This headless component provides a native `<input type="time">` element with `aria-label`, two-way value binding, and support for `required` and `disabled` states. The browser provides the time picker UI. The consumer provides all visual styling and any surrounding label or hint text.


## Styles

The consumer provides all CSS styling. The component renders with a `.time-input` class for targeting. No default styles are included — this is a fully headless component.


## Testing


- Verify the component renders a `<input>` element with class `time-input`
- Verify aria-label={label}` -- provides an accessible name for the input since no visible `<label>` element is included
- Verify pass-through attributes are applied

## Advice

- **Designers**: Pair the time input with a visible label and hint text showing the expected format, since native time picker appearance varies by browser.
- **Developers**: Use `min` and `max` attributes via restProps to constrain valid time ranges (e.g., business hours). The value is always in 24-hour HH:MM format regardless of display locale.
