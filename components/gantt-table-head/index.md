# Gantt Table Head

A Gantt table head is the header section of a Gantt chart grid, wrapping one or more rows that label the columns of the chart. Typically contains a row with a task-name column header and time-period column headers (e.g., weeks, months, sprints). It is designed to be used inside a GanttTable `<table>` structure.

The component renders a `<thead>` element and passes through its children, which are expected to be GanttTableRow or `<tr>` elements containing `<th>` header cells.

## Implementation Notes

- Renders as a `<thead>` element for the header section of a Gantt chart grid
- Children should be one or more rows with `<th>` cells labeling the task column and time-period columns
- Designed to be used inside a GanttTable `<table>` structure
- Spreads `restProps` onto the `<thead>` element for consumer customization
- No internal state -- purely a structural wrapper

## Props

- `children`: slot (required) -- header rows containing column labels for tasks and time periods
- `...restProps`: Any additional HTML attributes passed to the `<thead>` element

## Usage

```html
<GanttTable label="Project Alpha timeline">
  <GanttTableHead>
    <tr><th>Task</th><th>Week 1</th><th>Week 2</th><th>Week 3</th><th>Week 4</th></tr>
  </GanttTableHead>
  <GanttTableBody>...</GanttTableBody>
</GanttTable>
```

## Keyboard Interactions

None -- this component is a passive container. Keyboard navigation is handled by the parent GanttTable grid.

## ARIA

- Implicit `rowgroup` role from the `<thead>` element -- groups the header rows of the grid

## When to Use

- Use as the header section of a GanttTable to label the task-name column and time period columns (e.g., weeks, months, sprints).
- Avoid using outside of a GanttTable structure; this component depends on the parent table grid context.

## Headless

This headless component provides a `<thead>` element with implicit `rowgroup` role for grouping header rows within a Gantt chart grid. The consumer provides all visual styling including header background, typography, and column alignment.


## Styles

The consumer provides all CSS styling. The component renders with a `.gantt-table-head` class for targeting. No default styles are included — this is a fully headless component.


## Testing


- Verify the component renders a `<thead>` element with class `gantt-table-head`
- Verify pass-through attributes are applied

## Advice

- **Designers**: Make header labels concise and readable. For long timelines, consider multi-row headers (e.g., months on one row, weeks on another).
- **Developers**: Use `<th>` elements inside GanttTableRow children for proper header cell semantics. Add `scope="col"` to column headers for screen reader clarity.
