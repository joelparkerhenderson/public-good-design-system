# Summary List

A summary list is a component that presents a concise overview of key information as key-value pairs, typically in a structured, easy-to-scan format. It is often used to summarize important details such as transaction history, order details, product features, account settings, or form review data in a description list layout.

This component renders as a semantic `<dl>` (description list) element with an accessible label. Each item in the summary list consists of a `<dt>` (term) and `<dd>` (description) pair, helping users quickly grasp essential information. A well-designed summary list focuses on clarity, using clear labels, concise text, and consistent formatting to enhance readability.

## Implementation Notes

- Renders as `<dl aria-label={label}>` (description list) with a `children` slot
- Children typically contain `<dt>` (term) and `<dd>` (description) element pairs
- Semantic `<dl>` element provides description list semantics for key-value pairs
- Uses props rune for prop destructuring
- Spreads `...restProps` on the `<dl>` element for consumer extensibility
- No hardcoded user-facing strings; all text comes through props and children

## Props

- `label`: string (required) -- accessible label for the description list via `aria-label`
- `children`: slot (required) -- list content, typically `<dt>`/`<dd>` pairs
- `...restProps`: any additional HTML attributes spread onto the `<dl>` element

## Usage

```html
<SummaryList label="Order summary">
    <dt>Product</dt><dd>Widget</dd>
    <dt>Quantity</dt><dd>3</dd>
    <dt>Total</dt><dd>$29.97</dd>
</SummaryList>
```

## Keyboard Interactions

None -- this is a passive informational display, not an interactive element.

## ARIA

- `aria-label={label}` -- provides the accessible name for the description list, allowing screen readers to announce the context of the key-value pairs

## When to Use

- Use to display key-value pairs in a structured, scannable format such as order summaries, account details, form review pages, or configuration settings.
- Use when information is best presented as labeled terms with corresponding descriptions.
- Avoid for tabular data with multiple columns; use a Table component instead.
- Consider a Card when the information needs grouped visual containment beyond a flat list.

## Headless

This headless component renders a semantic `<dl>` element with `aria-label` for accessible naming. It provides description list semantics for key-value pairs. The consumer provides all visual styling including layout, spacing, typography, and row separation.


## Styles

The consumer provides all CSS styling. The component renders with a `.summary-list` class for targeting. No default styles are included — this is a fully headless component.


## Testing


- Verify the component renders a `<ol>` element with class `summary-list`
- Verify aria-label={label}` -- provides the accessible name for the description list, allowing screen readers to announce the context of the key-value pairs
- Verify pass-through attributes are applied

## Advice

- **Designers**: Align terms and descriptions consistently, using either a side-by-side or stacked layout. Use subtle row separators or alternating backgrounds to improve scannability.
- **Developers**: Use SummaryListItem child components for structured `<dt>`/`<dd>` pairs, or provide raw `<dt>`/`<dd>` elements directly. Ensure the `label` prop accurately describes the summary context.

## Composition

SummaryList uses the List/ListItem composition pattern. Place SummaryListItem components as children inside SummaryList. Each SummaryListItem renders a `<dt>`/`<dd>` pair within a `<div>` wrapper, while SummaryList provides the outer `<dl>` container with accessible labeling.
