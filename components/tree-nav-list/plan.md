# Tree Nav List — Implementation Plan

## Goal

Implement the Tree Nav List component: a hierarchical list with nested expandable items.

## HTML Tag and CSS Class

- HTML tag: <ol>
- CSS class: .tree-nav-list

## Dependencies

- Requires parent: tree-nav
- Requires children: tree-nav-list-item

## Approach

1. Use semantic <ol> element with class="tree-nav-list"
2. Add ARIA attributes for accessibility
3. Implement keyboard navigation
4. Add vanilla JavaScript for interactive behavior
5. Implement in HTML headless (plain HTML + vanilla JS)
6. Implement in Svelte headless (Svelte 5 + runes)
7. Implement in React, Vue, Blazor headless
8. Create tests for each implementation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Renders <ol> with class="tree-nav-list"
- [ ] `role="tree"` -- identifies the container as a tree widget for hierarchical data
- [ ] `aria-label={label}` -- provides an accessible name describing the purpose of the tree
- [ ] Keyboard: ArrowDown: Moves focus to the next tree item; wraps to the first item after the last
- [ ] Keyboard: ArrowUp: Moves focus to the previous tree item; wraps to the last item before the first
- [ ] Keyboard: Home: Moves focus to the first tree item
- [ ] Keyboard: End: Moves focus to the last tree item
- [ ] WCAG 2.2 AAA compliant
- [ ] Zero CSS — fully headless
- [ ] Tests pass in all implementations
