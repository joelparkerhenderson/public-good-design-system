# Drawer

A drawer is a panel that slides in from an edge of the viewport, typically used for navigation menus, filters, or supplementary content. It overlays the main content and can be dismissed by the user. The component renders conditionally based on its `open` state and uses `role="dialog"` with `aria-modal="true"` for proper screen reader behavior.

The `side` prop indicates which edge the drawer enters from via a `data-side` attribute, allowing consumers to apply appropriate positioning and animation styles. The drawer supports keyboard dismissal with the Escape key and provides a `tabindex="-1"` to allow programmatic focus management.

## Implementation Notes

- Conditionally renders a `<div>` with `role="dialog"` only when `open` is true
- Supports two-way binding on the `open` prop for two-way state binding
- Sets `aria-modal="true"` to indicate the drawer is a modal dialog
- Exposes `data-side` attribute for consumer CSS positioning (left, right, top, bottom)
- Sets `tabindex="-1"` to allow the drawer to receive focus programmatically
- Escape key handler sets `open` to `false`

## Props

- `open`: boolean (default: false) -- whether the drawer is visible, two-way bindable via `open`
- `label`: string (required) -- accessible name for the drawer
- `side`: "left" | "right" | "top" | "bottom" (default: "left") -- which edge the drawer enters from
- `children`: slot (required) -- drawer content

## Usage

```html
<Drawer label="Navigation" open={open} side="left">
  <nav>...</nav>
</Drawer>
```

```html
<Drawer label="Filters" open={showFilters} side="right">
  <form>...</form>
</Drawer>
```

## Keyboard Interactions

- Escape: closes the drawer by setting `open` to `false`

## ARIA

- `role="dialog"` -- identifies the drawer as a dialog for assistive technology
- `aria-label={label}` -- provides an accessible name for the dialog
- `aria-modal="true"` -- indicates the drawer is modal, restricting interaction to its contents
- `data-side={side}` -- data attribute for consumer CSS styling based on drawer position

## When to Use

- Use for navigation menus, filters, or supplementary content that should slide in from a screen edge without replacing the main view.
- Use when the content is contextual and temporary, not a primary destination.
- Avoid for critical actions that require a centered modal; use Dialog instead.
- Consider Sheet instead when the overlay should behave more like a bottom sheet on mobile devices.

## Headless

This headless component provides a `<div>` with `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, accessible labeling via `aria-label`, a `data-side` attribute for positioning, keyboard dismissal via Escape, and two-way binding on `open`. The consumer provides all visual styling, animations, backdrop, and positioning CSS.

## Advice

- **Designers**: Include a visible close button and consider adding a semi-transparent backdrop to indicate the main content is temporarily inaccessible. Animate the slide-in transition for a smooth experience.
- **Developers**: Trap focus within the drawer when it is open and return focus to the trigger element on close. Use the `data-side` attribute to apply directional CSS transitions.
