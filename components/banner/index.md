# Banner

A banner is a prominent component used to display important messages, updates, or calls to action at the top or bottom of an interface. Often spanning the full width of the screen, banners are designed to catch the user's attention without fully interrupting their experience. They are commonly used for announcements, cookie consent, warnings, promotions, or system alerts.

Banners may be persistent or dismissible, depending on the message's importance. This component supports four semantic variants (info, success, warning, error) exposed via a `data-type` attribute, and an optional dismiss button that hides the banner and invokes a callback. The `aria-live="polite"` region ensures screen readers announce banner content without interrupting the user.

## Implementation Notes

- Renders as `<div role="region" aria-live="polite">` for screen reader announcements
- Uses reactive state rune to track visibility; dismissing sets `visible` to `false`
- Dismissible banners render a `<button type="button">` with a configurable `aria-label`
- `data-type` attribute exposes the variant (info, success, warning, error) for consumer CSS
- The `dismiss()` function sets visibility to false and calls the `onclose` callback
- Uses `children` slot for flexible banner content rendering
- Spreads `...restProps` on the root `<div>` element for consumer extensibility
- Entire banner is conditionally rendered with conditional rendering
- No hardcoded user-facing strings; all text comes through props and children

## Props

- `type`: `"info"` | `"success"` | `"warning"` | `"error"` (default: `"info"`) -- banner variant for semantic meaning, exposed as `data-type`
- `dismissible`: boolean (default: `false`) -- whether the banner can be dismissed
- `onclose`: `() => void` (optional) -- callback invoked when the banner is dismissed
- `closeLabel`: string (optional) -- accessible label for the dismiss button via `aria-label`
- `children`: slot (required) -- the banner content
- `...restProps`: any additional HTML attributes spread onto the root `<div>` element

## Usage

```html
<Banner>Important announcement here.</Banner>
```

```html
<Banner type="warning" dismissible closeLabel="Dismiss" onclose={handleDismiss}>
    Your session will expire soon.
</Banner>
```

## Keyboard Interactions

- Tab: Focus the dismiss button (when `dismissible` is `true`)
- Enter/Space: Activate the dismiss button to hide the banner

## ARIA

- `role="region"` -- establishes the banner as a landmark region for assistive technology navigation
- `aria-live="polite"` -- ensures screen readers announce banner content without interrupting the current reading
- `aria-label={closeLabel}` -- provides the accessible name for the dismiss button when present

## When to Use

- Use for persistent, page-level messages such as announcements, cookie consent notices, system alerts, or promotional messages that span the full width of the interface.
- Use when a dismissible message needs to remain visible until the user explicitly closes it.
- Avoid for inline feedback tied to a specific form field or action -- use Alert instead.
- Consider Toast or Notification instead for brief, auto-dismissing messages.

## Headless

This component provides `role="region"` with `aria-live="polite"`, a `data-type` attribute for semantic variants, optional dismiss button with `aria-label`, and visibility state management, all with zero visual styling. The consumer is responsible for all CSS including background colors, text styling, dismiss button appearance, full-width layout, and position (sticky, fixed, or static).


## Styles

The consumer provides all CSS styling. The component renders with a `.banner` class for targeting. No default styles are included — this is a fully headless component.


## Testing


- Verify the component renders a `<div>` element with class `banner`
- Verify role="region"` -- establishes the banner as a landmark region for assistive technology navigation
- Verify aria-label={closeLabel}` -- provides the accessible name for the dismiss button when present
- Verify keyboard interactions work correctly
- Verify pass-through attributes are applied

## Advice

- **Designers**: Ensure the dismiss button has a minimum 44x44px touch target and is visually distinct. Use color and an icon together so meaning is not conveyed by color alone.
- **Developers**: Provide a meaningful `closeLabel` prop for the dismiss button so screen reader users understand its purpose. Handle the `onclose` callback to persist dismissal state if needed.
