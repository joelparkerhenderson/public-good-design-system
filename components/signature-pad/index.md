# Signature Pad

A signature pad provides a headless container for capturing handwritten signatures, typically using mouse, touch, or stylus input. Commonly used in contract signing workflows, consent forms, delivery confirmations, and legal document processing, the signature pad brings the familiar pen-on-paper signing experience to digital interfaces.

The component serves as a semantic container that consumers populate with their preferred drawing implementation, whether HTML canvas, SVG paths, or a third-party signature library. It uses `role="application"` to support complex pointer interactions, along with an accessible label describing the signing purpose.

## Implementation Notes

- Renders a `<div>` with `role="application"` to indicate complex widget behavior requiring pointer interaction
- Requires an `aria-label` describing the signing purpose for accessibility
- Consumers provide the actual drawing surface (canvas, SVG, etc.) as children
- Spreads `restProps` onto the container for consumer customization

## Props

- `label`: string (required) -- accessible description of the signature field via `aria-label`
- `children`: slot (required) -- drawing surface (canvas, SVG, or other input mechanism)

## Usage

```html
<SignaturePad label="Sign to accept terms">
  <canvas width="400" height="200"></canvas>
</SignaturePad>
```

## Keyboard Interactions

None -- this component is a passive container. Pointer-based interactions are handled by the consumer-provided drawing surface.

## ARIA

- `role="application"` -- indicates a complex widget with custom pointer interactions, informing assistive technologies to pass keyboard events through to the application
- `aria-label` -- provides an accessible description of the signature pad purpose

## When to Use

- Use when capturing a handwritten signature is required, such as for contracts, consent forms, delivery confirmations, or legal documents.
- Use when a pen-on-paper signing experience is needed in a digital interface.
- Avoid when a typed name or checkbox acknowledgment would suffice for the use case.
- Consider providing a text-based alternative for users who cannot use pointer-based input.

## Headless

This headless component provides a semantic container with `role="application"` and `aria-label` for complex pointer interactions. The consumer provides the actual drawing surface (HTML canvas, SVG, or third-party library) as children, along with all visual styling, stroke handling, and signature data capture.


## Styles

The consumer provides all CSS styling. The component renders with a `.signature-pad` class for targeting. No default styles are included — this is a fully headless component.


## Testing


- Verify the component renders a `<canvas>` element with class `signature-pad`
- Verify role="application"` -- indicates a complex widget with custom pointer interactions, informing assistive technologies to pass keyboard events through to the application
- Verify aria-label` -- provides an accessible description of the signature pad purpose
- Verify pass-through attributes are applied

## Advice

- **Designers**: Provide a clear border and placeholder text (e.g., "Sign here") so users understand where to draw. Include a visible clear/reset button alongside the pad.
- **Developers**: Offer a clear button to reset the signature and export the result as an image or data URL. Provide a keyboard-accessible alternative or fallback for users who cannot use pointer input.
