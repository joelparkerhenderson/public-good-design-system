# Spinoff

This page describes how to do a spinoff based on the NHS UK design system.

## Create a working directory

Create a work-in-progress directory such as:

```sh
mkdir ~/example
cd ~/example
```

## Get the NHS UK Design System

Download the NHS UK Design System repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend.git
```

## Get Svelte

For this example, we will convert to the Svelte web framework, which is similar
to React, Vue, Angular, etc. You can choose your own preferred web framework or
web library.

Download the Svelte documentation so the AI can read it:

```sh
curl https://svelte.dev/llms-medium.txt -o svelte-documentation-llms-medium.txt
```

## Get DaisyUI

For this example, we will convert the styles to the Tailwind DaisyUI components,
which are similar to Bootstrap, Bulma, Foundation, etc. You can choose your own
preferred styles framework or styles library.

Download the DaisyUI documentation:

```sh
curl https://daisyui.com/llms.txt -o daisyui-documentation-llms.txt
```

## AI agent

Create an AI agent prompt file any way you wish.

For this example, we will provide lots of specific instructions, by creating a file [`prompt.md`](prompt.md).

- If possible, use a stronger AI such as Anthropic Claude Code Opus 4, or Google Gemini 2.5 Pro, instead of a weaker LLM such as Microsoft Copilot, or OpenAI ChatGPT 4.

- If possible, use a larger LLM context window if possible, such as 200,000+ tokens. This is equivalent to about 500 pages of text or 100 images.

To view our file: [`prompt.md`].

## Run everything

Run:

```sh
claude prompt.txt
```

Output should look something like this:

```stdout
╭───────────────────────────────────────────────────╮

> prompt.md

⏺ I'll help you with the prompt.md file. Let me read it first to see what you'd like me to do with it.

⏺ Read(prompt.md)
  ⎿  Read 64 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ This looks like a comprehensive project specification for converting the NHS UK Design System from Nunjucks to a Public Good Design System using Svelte 5 and SvelteKit. Let me create
   a todo list to track this multi-step conversion project.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Verify dependencies and permissions exist before starting                             
     ☐ Fetch NHS UK Design System documentation and explore existing nhsuk-frontend directory
     ☐ Create comprehensive plan.md with technical implementation details
     ☐ Create tasks.md to track implementation progress
     ☐ Create new SvelteKit project with minimal template
     ☐ Set up Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI in SvelteKit project
     ☐ Analyze existing NHS UK components and create conversion strategy
     ☐ Convert components from NHS UK to Public Good Design System (alphabetically)
     ☐ Set up Playwright testing framework
     ☐ Configure static site deployment with adapter-static

⏺ Let me verify the dependencies and permissions exist as specified in your requirements…

⏺ Great! All required dependencies are present. Let me check if I can write to the target directory…

⏺ Perfect! I can see that the public-good-design-system-with-svelte directory already exists. Let me complete the first task and move to the next:

⏺ Now let me fetch NHS UK Design System documentation and explore the existing structure…

⏺ Perfect! Now let me explore some key components to understand their structure…

⏺ Now let me complete this task and create the comprehensive plan.md and tasks.md.

  Write(tasks.md)
  ⎿  Wrote 180 lines to tasks.md                               
     # NHS UK to Public Good Design System - Task Tracking
     *This file references the comprehensive plan in `plan.md`*
     ## Task Status Legend
     - ✅ Completed
     - 🔄 In Progress
     - ⏳ Pending
     - ❌ Blocked
     … +170 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Perfect! I've completed the initial analysis and planning phase for your NHS UK to Public Good Design System conversion project.

  Summary

  ✅ Dependencies Verified: All required files are present and accessible
  ✅ NHS UK Analysis Complete: Identified 35 components in alphabetical order
  ✅ Comprehensive Plan Created: plan.md with detailed technical approach
  ✅ Task Tracking System: tasks.md for implementation progress

  Key Findings

  - 35 NHS UK components need conversion from Nunjucks to Svelte 5
  - Systematic approach planned: Foundation → Architecture → Components → Integration
  - Modern tech stack: SvelteKit + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI + Playwright
  - Branding migration: "NHS UK"/"nhsuk-" → "Public Good"/"public-good-"

  The project is ready to begin implementation. Do you have any clarifying questions, or shall I proceed with creating the SvelteKit project foundation?
```

The AI will have many steps and work on each component. 

Eventually the output should look something like:

```
⏺ 🎉 PERFECT! All the components built successfully and the project is now 100% COMPLETE!
