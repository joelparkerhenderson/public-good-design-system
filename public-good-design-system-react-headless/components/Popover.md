# Popover

A popover is a UI component that displays contextual information or actions in an overlay that appears near the element that triggered it. The Popover component provides a headless conditional dialog container that renders its content only when the `open` state is true, with proper dialog semantics for accessibility.

Unlike tooltips, popovers can contain rich interactive content such as text, forms, buttons, or other controls. The component supports controlled component usage for the `open` prop, allowing parent components to control visibility. The consumer is responsible for providing trigger elements and managing open/close logic.

## Implementation Notes

- Conditionally renders a `<div>` with `role="dialog"` only when `open` is true
- Supports controlled component usage for the `open` prop
- The `label` prop provides the dialog's accessible name via `aria-label`
- Rest props are spread onto the `<div>` element
- The consumer must provide their own trigger element and open/close logic
- Content is provided via the `children` snippet

## Props

- `label`: string (required) -- accessible name for the popover dialog via `aria-label`
- `open`: boolean (default: false) -- controls whether the popover is visible; controlled
- `children`: ReactNode (required) -- the popover content
- `...restProps`: unknown -- additional attributes spread onto the `<div>` element

## Usage

```tsx

const [showPopover, setShowPopover] = useState(false);

<button onClick={() => setShowPopover(!showPopover)}>Toggle info</button>
<Popover label="Additional information" open={showPopover} onChange={setShowPopover}>
  <p>Here is some contextual information.</p>
  <button onClick={() => setShowPopover(false)}>Close</button>
</Popover>
```

## Keyboard Interactions

- Escape: Consumer should implement closing the popover by setting `open` to false
- Tab: Should trap focus within the popover when open (consumer responsibility)

## ARIA

- `role="dialog"` -- identifies the popover as a dialog overlay for assistive technology
- `aria-label="..."` -- provides the accessible name for the dialog
