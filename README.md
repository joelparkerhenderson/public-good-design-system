# Public Good Design System

Public Good Design System is a free open source design system that anyone can use and improve.

This is brand new work and we welcome collaboration, and guidance, and feedback.

This is based on work by [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/), [NHS UK](https://www.nhs.uk), [NHS Wales](https://www.nhs.wales/).
